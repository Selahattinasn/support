# yes i  want a detailed list or specific command scripts for a particular network task or context for to comprehensive guides with 30+ to 100+ practical commands, such as the full "Netsh Ultimate Guide" or specialized firewall or WLAN management command sets

Here is a detailed and comprehensive guide to practical netsh commands organized by important network administration tasks and contexts, with many commands included to approach 30+ to 100+ examples. This serves as a "Netsh Ultimate Guide" covering common use cases including IP configuration, firewall, WLAN, DHCP, and troubleshooting:

***

## 1. Basics \& Navigation

- `netsh` — Start netsh command-line tool (interactive mode).
- `netsh ?` or `help` — Show help for available commands.
- `exit` or `bye` — Exit netsh interactive session.
- `netsh interface show interface` — Show all network interfaces and their status.
- `netsh interface ip show config` — Show IP configuration details for all interfaces.
- `netsh wlan show profiles` — Show all stored Wi-Fi profiles.
- `netsh advfirewall show allprofiles` — Show Windows Firewall profiles states.

***

## 2. Network Interface IP Configuration

- Set static IP:

```
netsh interface ip set address "Ethernet" static 192.168.1.100 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1 1
```

- Switch to DHCP for IP:

```
netsh interface ip set address "Ethernet" dhcp
```

- Set primary DNS:

```
netsh interface ip set dns "Ethernet" static 8.8.8.8
```

- Add secondary DNS:

```
netsh interface ip add dns "Ethernet" 8.8.4.4 index=2
```

- Show current IP addresses:

```
netsh interface ip show address
```

- Reset TCP/IP stack to defaults (resets DHCP/DNS to default):

```
netsh int ip reset
```


***

## 3. Winsock and Network Repair

- Reset Winsock catalog (resolves many connectivity issues):

```
netsh winsock reset
```


***

## 4. Firewall Management (advfirewall context)

- Show all firewall rules:

```
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all
```

- Add rule to allow inbound TCP port 80:

```
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open Port 80" protocol=TCP dir=in localport=80 action=allow
```

- Block outbound UDP port 53:

```
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block DNS UDP" protocol=UDP dir=out localport=53 action=block
```

- Enable firewall:

```
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on
```

- Disable firewall:

```
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off
```


***

## 5. Wireless Network (WLAN) Management

- Show available wireless networks:

```
netsh wlan show networks
```

- Connect to Wi-Fi by profile name:

```
netsh wlan connect name="SSID_Name"
```

- Delete saved Wi-Fi profile:

```
netsh wlan delete profile name="SSID_Name"
```

- Export all Wi-Fi profiles to XML files:

```
netsh wlan export profile key=clear folder=C:\WiFiProfiles\
```


***

## 6. DHCP Client and Server Management

- Show DHCP client settings:

```
netsh dhcpclient show interface
```

- Release DHCP lease:

```
ipconfig /release
```

- Renew DHCP lease:

```
ipconfig /renew
```


***

## 7. IPsec Security Policies

- Show active IPsec policies:

```
netsh ipsec static show policy
```

- Add or remove IPsec policies with netsh requires detailed knowledge of IPsec setup and is less frequently used interactively.

***

## 8. Network Tracing and Diagnostics

- Start network tracing and capture packets:

```
netsh trace start capture=yes
```

- Stop network tracing and save output:

```
netsh trace stop
```

- Show trace providers:

```
netsh trace show providers
```


***

## 9. Advanced \& Scripting

- Save current configuration to a script file:

```
netsh -c interface dump > C:\Backup\netsh-config.txt
```

- Execute a saved script file:

```
netsh -f C:\Backup\netsh-config.txt
```

- Run commands on a remote computer (requires Remote Registry service running):

```
netsh -r RemotePCName interface show interface
```

- Run netsh commands under a different user:

```
netsh -u DOMAIN\Username -p Password interface show interface
```


***

## Summary Table of Common Commands

| Task | Command Example |
| :-- | :-- |
| Show interfaces | `netsh interface show interface` |
| Set static IP | `netsh interface ip set address "Ethernet" static IP MASK GW` |
| Enable DHCP | `netsh interface ip set address "Ethernet" dhcp` |
| Set DNS | `netsh interface ip set dns "Ethernet" static 8.8.8.8` |
| Reset TCP/IP stack | `netsh int ip reset` |
| Reset Winsock | `netsh winsock reset` |
| Show firewall rules | `netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all` |
| Open a firewall port | `netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open Port" ...` |
| Show Wi-Fi profiles | `netsh wlan show profiles` |
| Connect Wi-Fi | `netsh wlan connect name="SSID_Name"` |
| Export Wi-Fi profiles | `netsh wlan export profile key=clear folder=C:\WiFiProfiles\` |
| Start network trace | `netsh trace start capture=yes` |
| Stop network trace | `netsh trace stop` |

This list should serve both as a practical reference and a foundation for creating custom network management scripts with netsh, covering a wide range of common administrative needs including configuration, troubleshooting, security, and wireless management.

If you want, I can also prepare this list as a downloadable script file or organize it by a specific context in more detail. Let me know if you want further customization or examples for a particular use case.
