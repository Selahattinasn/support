# what was the shutdown kommands in windows

The primary command to shut down Windows from the command line is **shutdown.exe** with various parameters, such as **/s** for shutdown, **/r** for restart, **/l** for log off, and more.[^1][^2][^3]

## Common Windows Shutdown Commands

- **shutdown /s**
Shuts down the computer gracefully.[^2][^3][^4]
- **shutdown /r**
Restarts the computer instead of shutting down.[^3][^5]
- **shutdown /l**
Logs off the current user session without shutting down.[^5][^3]
- **shutdown /a**
Aborts a shutdown or restart that is already in progress.[^4][^3][^5]
- **shutdown /f**
Forces applications to close without warning the user (useful if system is stuck).[^3][^4][^5]
- **shutdown /t [seconds]**
Sets a delay (in seconds) before shutdown or restart; for example, "shutdown /s /t 60" shuts down in 60 seconds.[^4][^5][^3]
- **shutdown /p**
Turns off the computer without waiting for any timeout or warning (immediate power-off).[^6]


## Examples

- Immediate shutdown:
`shutdown /s /t 0`[^3][^4]
- Restart in 5 minutes:
`shutdown /r /t 300`[^3]
- Log off:
`shutdown /l`[^3]
- Abort a scheduled shutdown:
`shutdown /a`[^4]

These commands can be run from Command Prompt or PowerShell. They are useful for automating shutdown processes, scripting, and remote management of Windows computers.[^2][^5][^3]
